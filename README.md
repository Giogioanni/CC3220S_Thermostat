# **GPIO InputOutput Project**

## _Summarize the project and what problem it was solving._  
This project involved toggling an LED on and off using GPIO pins on my microcontroller. It introduced basic embedded system concepts and helped me solve the problem of understanding how to configure and control hardware output through software.

## _What did you do particularly well?_
I think I particularly excelled in setting up the GPIO configurations and ensuring that the LED toggled accurately with each software instruction, I believe I demonstrated a clear understanding of microcontroller pin setup and control.

## _Where could you improve?_
I could add a debounce mechanism (basically a technique that says “wait until this function hasn't been called in x time, and then run it”) for button inputs or implement a more user-friendly interface to control the LED.

## _What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?_
I added the GPIO documentation for the microcontroller, resources on embedded C programming, and community forums for Code Composer Studio to my support network that will help me in the future.

## _What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?_
I believe skills like configuring GPIO pins, debugging hardware issues, and understanding basic hardware-software integration are highly transferable to any project involving microcontrollers or embedded systems and will stay with me for my career.

## _How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_
I structured my code with clear comments, used descriptive variable names, and modularized the functionality for GPIO initialization and LED control. I believe this approach ensures that the project could be extended or modified easily.

# **Temperature Sensor Project**

## _Summarize the project and what problem it was solving._
This project involved reading temperature data from a sensor and displaying or responding to the readings, such as triggering an alert or controlling a device. I addressed the need for real-time temperature monitoring and control in embedded systems.

## _What did you do particularly well?_
I think I effectively implemented the sensor interface, made sure there were accurate readings, and calibrated the system to respond appropriately to temperature thresholds.

## _Where could you improve?_
I could add some improvements like incorporating advanced features like data logging, setting up a wireless communication, or implementing a more sophisticated threshold adjustments through user input.

## _What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?_
I added online tutorials for interfacing temperature sensors with microcontrollers, and debugging tools like serial monitors for analyzing sensor data.

## _What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?_
I think skills like interfacing sensors, being able to process real-time data, and implementing control mechanisms correctly based on input values, which is all directly applicable to a wide range of IoT and embedded system applications.

## _How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_
Same as the first project, I used modular programming to separate sensor reading, data processing, and output functionality into distinct functions. Which in turn made the code easy to understand and extend for future use.
